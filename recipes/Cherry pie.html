    <h2>How to make cherry pie filling</h2>
    <p>To make the filling, combine the halved cherries and other filling ingredients in a large bowl. Stir to mix, but don’t worry if you still see a few bits of cornstarch or sugar on the cherries. You’ll be able to more fully combine the filling ingredients after it rests for a few minutes and the cherries start to release their juices.</p>
    <h2>Flaky butter pie crust</h2>
    <p> Love to make a homemade pie crust for this pie because you can’t beat the taste and texture of a flaky, buttery from scratch crust. My method for making homemade crust is really easy and doesn’t require you to chill the dough before rolling it out. Even if you are new to making pie crust, I promise you can make this pie crust recipe!
        The key to a good pie crust is to keep the ingredients cold. Keep your butter in the refrigerator until you are ready to use it, and use ice cold water. 

This pie crust recipe makes enough for both a bottom and top pie crust. Divide the dough in half and shape each half into a round disk. Refrigerate one of the disks to use in a few minutes when you make the top pie crust. Roll the other disk out for the bottom crust. Wrap it around your rolling pin and transfer it to your pie dish.

    <h2>The finishing touches (and a latitice crust!)</h2>
    <p>Give the cherry filling another stir. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cherries to the pie crust, leaving any juices in the bowl to discard. Leaving the juices behind ensures that the filling sets up without being too liquidy.</p>

        <li>Dot with Butter</li>
        <li>Lattice Crust</li>
        <li>Egg Wash</li>
        <li>Sugar Sprinkle</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How long to bake cherry pie</h2>
    <p>After assembling the pie, refrigerate it for 20 to 30 minutes while your oven preheats. This chilling time helps to make sure the crust is cold when it goes into the oven, which will give you a flakier crust.

        You’ll start by baking the pie at 400° F for 20 minutes. Then reduce the oven temperature to 350° and continue baking the pie for 40 to 50 more minutes. About halfway through the baking time, start checking on the pie and loosely cover it with foil once the crust has browned to your liking. If you do not cover the pie, the crust can brown too much. The pie is done when the filling is bubbly.
        Be sure to let the pie cool for at least 2 hours after it bakes before slicing and serving. I know it’s hard to wait, but the pie needs to cool so that the filling can set up.</p>
